			<h1>Lab 13 - Loops</h1>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>

			<p>
				My partner and I worked together to create a FizzBuzz program that was flexible and easy to manipulate later. To accomplish this task
				we experimented with for loops and worked to abstract our program.
			</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>

			<p>
				The syntax of for loops is still a bit tricky for me, but the concept makes sense to me and I liked the way I refactored my code to make it simpler.
			</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>
				Here are my results, organized into neat columns thanks to observing Wes Modes's example. I also decided not to include input forms, but my partner did.
				Every multiple of 3 prints Fizz, multiples of 5 print Buzz and multiples of 7 print Boom.
