			<h1>Lab 14 - Debugging Tools & Strategies</h1>

			<h2>Challenge</h2>

			<p>
				Evan and I didn't have any code that wasn't working the way we intended to, but we continued to
				experiment with the debugging tools and strategies we covered in lecture.
			</p>

		</div>

			<h2>Problems</h2>

			<p>
				We didn't run into any syntax or logical problems, so we decided to refactor and add some features to our previous lab. I added forms for
				users to enter any number of factors to look for and Evan refactored his code to use an array of objects.
			</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>
				You can see my remastered Lab 13 <a href="../lab13/index.html">here</a>.

			<h2>Debugging</h2>

			<p>
				This is where I added new form boxes to accept numbers. I learned about number specific form boxes and how to set a minimun number to it.

			<p>
				Here is my javascript. I added two additinoal events and used for loops to generate more form boxes and retrieve their inputs.
