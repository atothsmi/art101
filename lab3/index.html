		<h1>Lab 3: File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
		<p>
			The goal of this lab is to become familiar with good practices for file structure and to understand why having
			a file structure is helpful. We will practice creating a file structure and creating files withing the file structure.
		</p>

		<h2>Challenges</h2>
		<p>
			I had some difficulty figuring out appropriate names for files that would help me find them later. I didn't want to make
			them too abstract, but I also needed to make sure that I would remember what they were later. The file structure helps to
			make files easier to find later, regardless of what I've named them.
		</p>

		<h2>Results</h2>

			First, I created file organization for my future ART 101 labs as shown here:
