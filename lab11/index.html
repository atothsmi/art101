			<h2>Challenge</h2>

			<p>
				Today, my partner and I worked together to add buttons with jQuery that affect the style of the
				page by manipulating the classes of an element and having those classes styled in our CSS.
			</p>

		<div id='problems'>
			<h2>Problems</h2>

			<p>
				I misspelled many things which lead to things not connecting, so I frequently used console.log to
				identify which sections of my code were bugged. Other than the misspelling, I understood the syntax
				and how jQuery handles events/elements well.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div id='results'>
			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>
				My results are present throughout this page. Click on the button in each section to reveal a
				completely different style for that section! This style can be toggled on and off by repeatedly
				clicking the button in the section.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here is my results for the bonus task! The each button changes the other's style and reverts their
				style back to the default style.
			</p>
