		<h2>Challenge</h2>

		<p>
			The challenge for this lab was to produce pseudocode for tasks and to think about how high level tasks can break down into smaller tasks.
			My partner and I worked together to break the tasks we chose into appropriately sized chunks.
		</p>

	<div class="standard-div">
		<h2>Problems</h2>

		<p>
			I have done a lot of pseudocoding before, so I struggled with thinking about higher level tasks first, before breaking down the task into
			smaller chunks. In addition, I wanted to create some multi-use classes for my site that I could apply to a bunch of my future labs, so I had
			some difficulty which CSS features I wanted to keep consistent throughout. In my head, idea of general purpose classes is to define as little
			as possible, but as much as I need. It was a little tricky to find that balance.

		<h2>Results</h2>
			<p>First, we created pseudo code describing how to download a game from steam.</p>
			<pre><code>
				Download Steam
					Go to store.steampowered.com.
					Make a Steam account
					Click “Install Steam”
					Accept all in the Steam start-up wizard
				Open Steam
				Find the game you want to purchase
				Purchase game
					Add game to cart
					Select payment option
					Agree to Terms of Service
					Hit Purchase
				Download Game from Steam App
			</pre></code>

		<p>Then we outlined the steps to create the game Hangman. We planned our version to allow players to play against the computer. </p>
		<pre><code>
			/*
			 * Practice pseudocoding by outlining the steps to code hangman
			 * Authors: Alia Toth-Smith and Evan Pompa.

			 */

			 // Hangman
			   // 1. Pick a word
			     // a. Choose a random word from a comprehensive English dictionary
			     // b. Verify word does not contain special characters
			   // 2. Draw Gallows
			   // 3. Inform player of how many letters are in the word
			    // a. Draw underscores in a line equivalent to the number of characters in the word
			   // 4. Accept player guess
			     // a. Verify if player guess is a valid single character
			     // b. Verify player has not previously guessed the same character
			   // 5. Show results to player
			     // a. If player guess is in the word
			       // i. Remove underscore(s) in place of player guess
			       // ii. Replace removed underscores with guessed letter
			     // b If player guess isn’t in the word
			       // i. tell player their guess was incorrect
			       // ii. draw next body part
			   // 6. Check for win or lose condition
			     // a. If hangman is filled, player loses
			     // b. If word slots are all filled in, player wins
			     // c. else repeat steps 4-6

		<p>Finally, I designed the look of this page with css. I tested my css locally by using the inspect feature of chrome to test possible changes.</p>
