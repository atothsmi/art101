 // Hangman
   // 1. Pick a word
     // a. Choose a random word from a comprehensive English dictionary

    // a. Draw underscores in a line equivalent to the number of characters in the word
   // 4. Accept player guess
     // a. Verify if player guess is a valid single character
     // b. Verify player has not previously guessed the same character
   // 5. Show results to player

       // i. tell player their guess was incorrect
