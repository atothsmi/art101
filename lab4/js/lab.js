 // Hangman
   // 1. Pick a word
     // a. Choose a random word from a comprehensive English dictionary
     // b. Verify word does not contain special characters
   // 2. Draw Gallows
   // 3. Inform player of how many letters are in the word
    // a. Draw underscores in a line equivalent to the number of characters in the word
   // 4. Accept player guess
     // a. Verify if player guess is a valid single character
     // b. Verify player has not previously guessed the same character
   // 5. Show results to player
     // a. If player guess is in the word
       // i. Remove underscore(s) in place of player guess
       // ii. Replace removed underscores with guessed letter
     // b If player guess isn’t in the word
       // i. tell player their guess was incorrect
       // ii. draw next body part
   // 6. Check for win or lose condition
