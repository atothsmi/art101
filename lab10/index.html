			<h1>Lab 10: JavaScript Events & Forms</h1>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>

			<p>
				Today, my partner and I experimented with JavaScript events and forms. We took and manipulated user input using
				pure JavaScript and displayed the results.
			</p>

			<h2>Problems</h2>

			<p>
				We didn't have any problem retrieving the information from our form, however we struggled to create the new anagram
				function. We first used a skeleton of pseudocode to plan out what we needed. Then we filled in the pseudocode and tested
				it to make sure it did what we expected it to do. We had to think about which variable type would be best for this and
				research several new array methods. Finally, we looked at our consoles to figure out what was going wrong and we worked
				to debug our code.

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<div class='standard-div'>
				<label for="user-name">Please input your name:</label>
				<input id="user-name" type='text' name='user-name'>
				<button id='my-button' type="button">Sort!</button><br><br>

				<div id="output"></div>
			</div>



			<p>
				Here is the JavaScript that produced the results above!
