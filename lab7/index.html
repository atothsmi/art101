			<h1>Lab 7: Functions</h1>
		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>

			<p>
				For this lab, my partner and I worked together to make a function that takes a user's input and sorts it by case and then alphabetically.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Problems</h2>

			<p>
				I forgot how sort() worked, so I had to ask my partner to explain it to me again to see what I was missing in my code. We also wanted to
				figure out if join() returned a value or if it performed the operation in place. We realized that join() switches the given object from
				an array to a string, so it must return a value.
			</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>
				When this page is loaded, it prompts the user to input a name. Here is the results of my function after taking in the user's input!
			</p>

				<h3>Script Output</h3>

				<div class="output">
					<script type="text/javascript" src="js/lab.js"></script>
				</div>

			</div>

			<p>
				Here is a screenshot of the javascript that produces the result shown above!
