				represented our main transport and the characteristics associated with it.

			<h2>Problems</h2>

			<p>
				I had struggled to find an appropriate way for me to print out my object and array in the console that made sense with English grammar, but I figured
				it out with some trial and error, in addition to careful close reading of the console.log statement.

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>
				Here are my object and array printed out. I printed out my array in two ways, the first using a for loop to add spaces between the elements of an
				array and the second using the built in method of displaying an array.
