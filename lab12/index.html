		<div>
			<h2>Challenge</h2>

			<p>
				This week, Evan and I created a function that sorts the user based on a special parameter a.k.a
				*cough* the length of their name. We created these functions to practice using conditionals. We also
				created a second, refactored version of the same function using objects and arrays.
			</p>

		</div>

		<div>
			<h2>Problems</h2>

			<p>
				I forgot to use defer in when I linked my javascript into my code. This caused a problem. After this was resolved,
				everything worked when we managed to correct our syntax errors.
			</p>

		</div>

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>
				Here are the results of my experiments! It sorts a user into a category based on a
				mysterious yet to be uncovered parammeter. All you have to do is put in your name!
			</p>

			<div>

				<label>Please Enter Your Name for Sorting:</label>

				<input id="input"></input>

				<button id="button">Submit!</button>

				<div id="output"></div>
